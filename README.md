# QuickFunctions

A module designed to take less time in rewriting functions basic functions for JavaScript!
It can be used across multiple JavaScript frameworks (since they all work the same, practically) and most libraries you're developing, whatever for!

Currently supports the following functions:

- `timeout()` - *written as `setCommandTimeout()`*
- `clearTimeout()` - *written as `clearCommandTimeout()`*
- `setInterval()` - *written as `setCommandInterval()`*
- `clearInterval()` - *written as `clearCommandInterval()`*
- `Date()` - *I've made this as `currentTime()` and retrieves the current time*

## And a Discord specific regex for obtaining user mentions!

- `getUserFromMention` - *written as `getUserFromMention()` and retrieves userID in a regex format*
