# QuickFunctions

A module designed to take less time in rewriting functions basic functions for JavaScript!  
It can be used across multiple JavaScript frameworks (since they all work the same, practically) and most libraries you're developing, whatever for!
  
Currently supports the following functions:  
- timeout
- clearTimeout
- setInterval
- clearInterval  
## And a Discord specific regex for obtaining user mentions!
- getUserFromMention
